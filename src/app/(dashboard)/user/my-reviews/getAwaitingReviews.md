# Get Awaiting Reviews API Documentation

## Overview

The Get Awaiting Reviews endpoint allows authenticated guest users to retrieve a list of their completed bookings that do not yet have reviews submitted. This helps guests identify which bookings they can still review after their stay.

## Authentication

This endpoint requires authentication via the `x-user` header containing a JSON object with user information:

```json
{
  "uid": "user-uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "guest"
}
```

The middleware `@/src/lib/middlewares/verify.token.ts` handles authentication and populates `req.user` with this information.

#### Notes

- This endpoint is specifically for guests to see which of their completed bookings still need reviews
- The response includes property details and room types to help guests identify their bookings
- Bookings are sorted by creation date or check-in date as specified
- Pagination is implemented to handle large numbers of bookings efficiently
- Only bookings with status "completed" and no existing review are returned

## Database Query

The endpoint performs the following database operations:

1. Finds the user by UID to get the internal user ID
2. Queries bookings where:
   - `user_id` matches the authenticated user
   - `status` equals "completed"
   - `review` is null (no review exists)
3. Includes property information with room details
4. Applies sorting and pagination
5. Counts total records for pagination metadata

## Use Cases

- Display a "Write Review" section in guest dashboards
- Show pending review notifications
- Allow guests to track which bookings they've reviewed
- Provide quick access to review submission for completed stays
